# Cubic_Roots_Equation

I created this project for an Engineering Class in my second year at USF. My professor prompted the class to create a way to efficiently find all 3 roots to a cubic equation with random inputs for the each coefficient and the constant. He did not give a specific method that we needed to use. 

I decided I wanted use Java to create a program that would efficiently solve this problem. At the due date, each person had to demonstrate their method in front of the class and show the their project worked with random inputs that were given by the professor. My project was the only one, in the entire class of 75+ people, to actually work, and it worked flawlessly.
